    <p class="text-success"> The DPS Society (DPSS) is a non-profit, non-proprietary educational body widely recognized for its selfless and unstinting commitment to excellence in education.

 

The DPSS established its first school in 1949 at Mathura Road in New Delhi. Today it has more than 100 schools in India and abroad apart from 9 core schools and its affiliates in Delhi alone.

 

DPSS under the able guidance of stalwarts like Shri V. K. Shunglu, Chairman DPSS seeks to provide holistic and quality education to all members of society. This is suitably reflected in its motto ' Service before Self '. DPS Schools have produced self-confident, self-reliant individuals who are versatile and endowed with a spirit of adventure and creativity. The Council of Educational Planning and Training (CEPT) encourages and promotes innovative trends in education that help both the teachers and the students. The Council of Environment Education and Culture (CEEC) helps children in all DPS Schools to value, conserve and preserve their natural environment. The Arts and Heritage Council, the Media, Publication, Sports and Health divisions also foster quality education.

 

Thus DPS Society has proved that with determination, good management, right vision and altruism one can produce global citizens with the right moral fiber, who are ready to be the torchbearers of the 21st Century.</p>
